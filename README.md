# Text_Processing_RNN_LSTM
Text_Processing_RNN_LSTM leverages RNN and LSTM models for advanced text processing. It features deep learning techniques for NLP tasks, utilizing GloVe for word embeddings, aimed at both educational and practical applications. The sophisticated text processing framework that utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Designed to tackle various NLP tasks, this project demonstrates the power of deep learning in understanding and generating text. By incorporating GloVe word embeddings, DeepTextRNN enhances the semantic analysis of text, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers alike.

## Features

- **RNN and LSTM Implementation:** Harnesses the sequential nature of text for accurate processing and prediction.
- **GloVe Word Embeddings:** Utilizes GloVe for improved word representation, enriching the model's understanding of language nuances.
- **Text Data Preprocessing:** Offers tools for efficiently preparing text data for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Demonstrates the end-to-end process of training deep learning models on text data and evaluating their performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed. It's also recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv deepenv
source deepenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `deepenv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DeepTextRNN.git
cd DeepTextRNN
